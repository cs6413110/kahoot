/*
Actually seth we will be using js files because the school blocked static github hosting and even if they didn't ssl prevents server communication without a domain.

We can still use CSS, but it will be executed via js.

Write your html code in a seperate file and we can implement tomorrow.

So dont use the .html file? or dont create a .css? or what else do I use?
