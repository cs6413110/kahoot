/*
Actually seth we will be using js files because the school blocked static github hosting and even if they didn't ssl prevents server communication without a domain.

We can still use CSS, but it will be executed via js.

Write your html code in a seperate file and we can implement tomorrow.





So don't use the .html file? or don't create a .css? Or what else do I use?

A: We are going to combine them all in a js file. You can start by doing whatever you want and I'll combine it tomorrow.
